# VernsWorld
My personal website from its relaunch in June of 2019 going forward.

After taking a Full Stack bootcamp I decided that I should go back to working on my website. The remnants of the old site can be seen at www.panix.com/~vernonw. I am building it from scratch and that means deciding what it wants to be when it grows up, all over again.  My plan is to update it monthly. The first month was spent mostly getting the domain name back (I had it before and the domain name processing site seems not to work anymore!) Next I will put in some content as I decide what I want the site to become.
